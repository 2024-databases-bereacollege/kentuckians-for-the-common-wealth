# Exercises

These are (mostly) simple exercises designed to highlight different pieces of a traditional web application. To try one, get the branch with `git checkout BRANCH-NAME`, and don't forget to start the app with `flask run`.

Get your hands dirty! The best way to figure out how a system works is by modifying parts of it and seeing the resulting changes. Even though some of these exercises are completed in the main branch, resist the urge to just look at that code and copy it. Look at similar code to see how it works, wrestle with the logic, read the errors, read the documentation, and search google for help with the concepts, because that is how you will solve 99% of your solo programming problems. This is about learning, not about getting the job done - so asking generative AI for clarity is good, asking for code is bad.
