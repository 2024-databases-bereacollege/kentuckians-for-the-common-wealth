Flask can use a variety of decorators to enhance application functionality.
In this case we are using `before_request` to add code that executes before
every request to the application. 

This method gets a user from the database and assigns it to an attribute of 
Flask's global object, `g`.  `g` is available in all templates, and is defined
for the duration of the request. Note: `g` does NOT persist between different 
requests. Sessions, cookies, and the database must be used for true persistence.

Obviously, hard-coding one particular student as the logged-in user is not what
a real application would do. In practice, this function would get a user from 
whatever the login/authentication system has stored in the session.
